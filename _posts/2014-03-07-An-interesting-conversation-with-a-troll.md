Recently, [{{ external.author }}][patrick-tumblr] of Giant Bomb had an interesting conversation with a troll and decided to share it. In a surprising turn of events, the troll actually had some interesting things to say:

> Real, lasting, positive social change is not won through wars or revolutions, and certainly not through being an insensitive ass on Twitter. Only gradual progress achieved through non-violent means is capable of transforming our world into a more ideal setting. However, going back to my first point, this is the internet. It's a different context requiring a different response. If I saw someone else make the tweet I made, I would laugh, not because I take suicide lightly or want Nguyen to be miserable, but because: here's some random Vietnamese guy upsetting millions of people across the world, over an extremely simplistic phone game, due to some autistic tantrum, and the comment has just reduced his entire existence and all of their cares into five words. The humor of this scenario is self-evident to me, but I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea.
