About every six months or so I get bored with my setup and go poking around in an attempt to spice things up. One of the first things I start messing around with is my text editor theme. The last two however, I never got around to releasing and now seems like as good a time as any.

<div class="scrots">
    <figure class="scrots-scrot">
        <a href="{{ get_asset('images/words/mint.png') }}"><img src="{{ get_asset('images/words/mint-thumb.png') }}" width="348" height="185" alt="Mint"></a>
        <figcaption>Mint</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure class="scrots-scrot">
        <a href="{{ get_asset('images/words/ash.png') }}"><img src="{{ get_asset('images/words/ash-thumb.png') }}" width="348" height="185" alt="Ash"></a>
        <figcaption>Ash</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

The older of the two is mint. It was mostly an attempt at overcoming my everlasting struggle with brown. I love the idea of brown, but I can just never seem to pull it off. I feel I made it halfway there. I was going for more of a foresty vibe, but in the end the only image that comes to mind is that of a carrot.

Ash was more or less a happy accident. I just started messing around and ended up knocking it out in a day. I really like how it came together. At the start a volcano came to mind and I just ran with it. I like the bit of green, it really adds some variety without looking out of place.

Both are available on [GitHub][themes-repo] along with my two other themes: Erebus and Monokai Dark.
