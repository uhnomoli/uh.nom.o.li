_Another static site generator?_

With the ever growing population of static site generators, all filling a certain need, I've yet to find one that allows the generation of anything but the simplest of blogs.

My attempt to solve this, or at the least offer an alternative to existing solutions, was mynt. The goal being to give you all the features of a CMS with none of the often rigid implementations of those features.

Some of the design goals were:

+ Multiple ways of accessing data.
+ Automatic generation of common pages such as those for archives and tags.
+ Freedom in the markup language and rendering engine used.

Written in Python, mynt is [open source][source], BSD licensed, and [documented][docs].
